# TECHNICAL INTERVIEW PRACTICE

  This repo is a compilation of solutions for common tech interview questions and algorithms.


## Practices for C solutions

 * All programs were compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
 * Code written in Betty style and checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 * No more than 5 functions per file
 * All header files are include guarded

## Practice for Python Solutions
 * All files were interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
 * All files ends with a new line
 * The first line of all files is #!/usr/bin/python3
 * Code written in PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
 * All files are executable
 * All modules have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
 * All classes have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
 * All functions (inside and outside a class) have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
